  <div id="about">About Us</div>
  <div id="about1">Started by four friends, who took the plunge after long contemplative journeys, NE had its humble beginnings in 2017 in Thrissur, the cultural capital of Kerala. When time flew in with its winged chariot, Nostalgia Events also spread its wings and flew far and wide. Starting off with covering weddings in Kerala, the team soon found itself helping create memories across all four southern states and even as far as Odisha and Udaipur. The work that the team has done in such a short span of time in many ways captures the vivid colours and dynamism of our country and specifically our clients hailing from a variety of social and cultural backgrounds.
